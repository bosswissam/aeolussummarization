For an Aeolus user, analyzing an Aeolus event log can prove to be a daunting task, especially when this log grows to include millions of records. Similarly, storing such an event log can be very costly. The system I present in this thesis provides an interface that allows the creation of user-defined summaries of the Aeolus audit trails, as well as marking of events in the log for future archiving or deletion. Our system makes it easier to analyze the Aeolus event log and less costly to store events of interest. This is done through the use of a \emph{QuerySystem} and \emph{SummaryObjects}.
I present the system in the context of a sample application based on the financial management service \emph{www.mint.com}. The system is an extension to the Aeolus library, it is implemented in Java code and uses PostgreSQL 9.0 as it's primary database.
