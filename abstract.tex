For an Aeolus user, analyzing an Aeolus event log can prove to be a daunting task, especially when this log grows to include millions of records. Similarly, storing such an event log can be very costly. The system I present in this thesis provides an interface for the creation of user-defined summaries of the Aeolus audit trails, as well as truncation of the event log, making it easier for to analyze the Aeolus event log and less costly to analyze events of interest. This is done through through the use of what we term a \emph{Summary System} and \emph{Summary Objects}.
I present the system in the context of a sample application based on \emph{www.mint.com}. The system is an extension to the Aeolus library, it is written in Java and uses a PostgreSQL database as it's primary database.
