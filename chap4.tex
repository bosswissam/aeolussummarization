\chapter{Auditing the Mint Application}
\label{mint:auditing}

In this chapter we discuss auditing and how the audit trail can be used for discovery.

As described in section \ref{aeolus}, every security-related event is logged automatically by Aeolus. In addition, applications can log events of their own. We take advantage of this in the Mint system by logging application-specific events; an example is given in section \ref{audit:mint-example}.

Events are stored in a table that we will refer to as the \emph{LOG}. The LOG is useful for discovery, which can be done by means of a query over the table. Table \ref{table:bob-declass} and figure \ref{fig:user-activity} show two examples.

Table \ref{table:bob-declass} shows which principals declassified Bob's tag; thus, it shows which users accessed Bob's information. In a secure implementation of the Mint application, no user principal other than Bob's principal should be able to declassify Bob's tag. However we introduced a bug in our implementation of the Mint application to demonstrate how the LOG can be used for discovery, and hence we can see that many principals, running on behalf of other users, were able to declassify Bob's tag - something that should never happen. In this example, the LOG helps us discover the leakage of Bob's information due to an application error.

Figure \ref{fig:user-activity} shows a graph of how many user requests caused a declassification of a user data tag for every 5-second period since the application launched; in other words, it shows the activity trend of the user. Any spike in the graph means that the user was abnormaly active in certain periods of time. In this example, the LOG helps us discover if any user accountrs were compromised.

\label{fig:user-activity}
\end{figure}
In the following section we describe how the data for Figure \ref{fig:user-activity} can be extracted from the LOG, as well as the possible uses of summarization for this scenario.

\section{Detecting Suspicious User Activity}
\label{audit:mint-example}
In order to gather the information necessary to produce the graph in figure \ref{fig:user-activity}, we add application-specific events to the LOG for each different action the user takes.

For example, when Bob signs up successfully with our application, we record his username, ``Bob'', as well as his data tag and the principal authoritative for that tag. This is done using the following call\footnote{Recording the principal ID and the number of the tag is enough to retrieve the full information about a principal and a tag from the AS.}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, label=code:create-event]
  AeolusLib.createEvent(``mint-user-signup'', Arrays.asList(new String[] {``Bob'', ``5'', ``10''}));
\end{lstlisting}

To obtain a table detailing the username, principal, data tag and other sign-up information of all users, we use the following SQL query based on our application-specific events\footnote{\emph{to\_array} is a procedure that turns a comma-delimited string into a PSQL array.}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, deletendkeywords={TIMESTAMP}, label=code:mint-signup]
select to_array(app_arg)[0] as pid, to_array(app_arg)[1] as username, to_array(app_arg)[2] as tag, timestamp as signed_up, event_counter from events where op_name='mint-user-signup'
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Table \ref{table:users-info} shows a possible result of running the query, with some extra information about the time when each user signed up.

\begin{table}

\caption*{Users' Information}
\caption[Mint Users Information]{This is a table detailing the information about users signing up during a simulated run of the Mint application. The \emph{pid} column denotes the user's principal, the \emph{username} column denotes the user's username, the \emph{tag} column denotes the user's data tag, the \emph{signed\_up} column denotes the time at which the sign up event took place, and the \emph{event\_counter} column denotes the unique event\_counter number of the sign up event.}
\label{table:users-info}
\end{table}

Finally, we can obtain the information necessary to create the graph in figure \ref{fig:user-activity} using the following query:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, deletendkeywords={TIMESTAMP}, label=code:query-accesses]
select e.count, users.username, e.to_timestamp as timestamp from (select count(*), tags_modified, (to_timestamp(((extract (epoch from events.timestamp)/5)::int)*5)) from events tags_modified in (select tag from users) group by (to_timestamp(((extract (epoch from events.timestamp)/5)::int)*5)), tags_modified) as e inner join users on e.tags_modified=users.tag
\end{lstlisting}

Table \ref{table:jack-activity} shows a the result of a modified version of this query that shows information just for the user Jack. This query provides us with a count of how many requests by Jack caused a declassification of a user data tag for every 5-second period of time since the application launch.

\begin{table}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\caption*{Account activity for user Jack}
\caption[Mint Account activity for user Jack]{This table shows the number of declassifies done by Jack's principal in each five-second period since the application launched. The \emph{count} denotes such number. The \emph{username} column denotes the user who's data tag is in question. The \emph{timestamp} column denotes the start of the 5-second period. A table containing similar information for all users would be a precursor to producing the graph in figure \ref{fig:user-activity}, here we only show this data for user Jack for simplicity.}
