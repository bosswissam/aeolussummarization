\chapter{Introduction}

Maintaining the security of confidential online information, such as medical records and financial data, is a very important task. Recent research has focused on Decentralized Information Flow Control (DIFC) as the most promising approach to enable application developers to secure information. DIFC is based on the principle that the system tracks information as it flows through the system, and only allows information to be released if the releaser has sufficient authority. In fact, DIFC allows for fine-grained control of information flow so that security policies can be tailored to the needs of individual users and organizations.

This thesis extends the security support provided by the Aeolus platform. Aeolus is a platform that combines DIFC and an intuitive security model framework to make it more convenient for developers to build secure applications on a distributed system. Additionally, Aeolus provides automatic auditing of every security related event that occurs while an application runs. Furthermore, it provides a way for applications to log additional events that are meaningful at the application level. The audit trail is an important component of overall security which allows for the discovery of errors that cause security policies to be subverted; the audit trail can also be used to discover attacks.

A common issue in most auditing systems, including the Aeolus system, is that the audit trails can become extremely large. This is especially true if the system being audited is large, e.g., has millions of users, and is long-lived. Therefore, a way of reducing the stored information and making the important information more easily accessible is needed.

This thesis addresses this problem. It provides a framework that allows groups of events in the audit trail to be summarized: the important content of the group of events is captured in a \emph{summary event}, which is much smaller than the group. Once information has been summarized, the base events that underlie the summary can be moved to archival storage, or even deleted.  An additional benefit is that summary events make it easier to access application-specific information, than the base events they summarize, because they can be defined to explain the information in application-specific terms.

A final point is that the production of the summary events is itself controlled by information flow.  This is important because, everything a system does is detailed in the audit log, and therefore, there is a potential for information leaks or data corruption if the log could be accessed by an unauthorized party.

The next two sections describe the motivation and outline of this thesis.

\section{Motivation for Summarization and Archiving}

Summarization allows developers to group information that is spread out over the Aeolus audit trails into smaller space. This allows for future archiving or truncation of the Aeolus log, as well as possibly allowing for faster queries to be used.
%While the the Aeolus audit trail details all events that took place since an application started, analyzing the audit trail can be a costly task , . Allowing application developers to define a semantic meaning for events, or groups of events, helps in analyzing the history of the system.

Take for example a bank's web administrator who is interested in detecting suspicious activity on customers' bank accounts. One way to do this is to produce a plot of the number of outbound transfers carried through a user's account for every week in the last year. Any spikes in the rate of outbound transactions per week could mean that a user's account has been compromised by an attacker. Finally, the administrator might wish to periodically produce such a plot.

Producing such information is possible through the current auditing mechanisms available in Aeolus. However, in order to accomplish such a task, the administrator's audit will have to scan all events in the system in the past year, which could span millions of events, once a periodic basis, and this could be very costly in terms of time and resources.

Summarization solves this problem by allowing the web administrator to store periodic computations as summaries themselves, and simply reusing these summaries in future audits. For example, the web administrator could store the average number of outbound transfers a user has made per week in the last year and use that as a benchmark for future user activity.

%\section{Scope}

%As security platform developers, tackling the problem of summarization and archival raises a number of questions: what usage scenarios are we trying to satisfy? How do we generalize our model to satisfy those scenarios? What guarantees do we provide to our developers? And how do we maintain those guarantees?

%Our system, in similar fashion to Aeolus, assumes an application developer to be active and aware of the workings of Aeolus as a whole. We do not intend for our system to impose any restrictions on the developer, and hence the developer would have to be careful with the summarization power granted to them through the our system. For example, summaries could be an added source of information leakage if not used correctly.

%Those are the basic assumptions we made while building the system, and most design decisions stem from them. While reading the following chapters, the reader should expect to gain a better understanding of the definitions of the questions posed above, the design problems they pose, and how we answer them.

\section{Thesis Outline}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 2 presents an overview of the Aeolus security system. Chapter 3 presents a sample Aeolus application based on the financial management service \emph{www.mint.com}. Chapter 4 describes an example of application-level logging and possible uses of the audit trails. Chapter 5 describes the summarization models and interfaces. Chapter 6 details examples of how to use our summarization system. Chapter 7 describes the implementation details of the system. Chapter 8 discusses related work. Chapter 9 reviews the contributions of this thesis and presents some topics for future work.
