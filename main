Intro
Aeolus Intro
 - DIFC overview
 - Mint Example
   - AS model (Figure)
   - Persistence model (Figure)
   - Shared Memory objects
   - uses (what we allow to be done without info leakage)
Motivation for Summarization
 - General argument
 - Mint Example
   - auditing uses (Accesses bar graph figure)
   - auditing using summaries (Timeline Figure)
The Model
 - Base log
 - Requirements of Summarization
 - Summarization Model
   - Summarizing the events table
     - Storage
        - Storing Queries
     - Querying summaries
   - Summarizing summaries
   - Deleting summaries
     - Logging deletes
       - Placeholders
       - argument for overall reduction of space usage
Implementation
 - Functional SQL vs JDBC
   - Choice of JDBC, why?
 - Interface
   - SummarySystem
   - SymmaryObject
   - Discussion of how the interface satisfies the model
   - Uses/Examples (Figure, same as bar graph above, but missing some details).
 - DIFC in summarizaiton (summaries inherit lables of caller).
 - Running in a distributed system (right now the implementation is saving the summaries locally).
Performance
 - time taken for queries over events and summaries tables (producing the same information)
 - Storage reduction (when we consider truncation)
